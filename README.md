# Time-Series-Modeling
Box Jenkins Methodology

Abstract:

The "Great Lakes" data set is an example of a non-seasonal, non-stationary time series that
experiences a slight upward linear trend. The series is differenced and transformed using
"Box-Cox" in order to stabilize the mean and variance, correcting for stationarity. The best
model fitted for the data was an ARIMA(4,1,0) found by observing the partial and auto
correlation functions. The fit suggested the best estimates for the coefficients via the AIC.
Verified as independent random variables, the residuals of the fitted model were tested for
normality using the McLeod-Li, Ljung-Box, and Shapiro-Wilk test. The model proved to be
an adequate representation of the data providing reasonable predictions for precipitation.
